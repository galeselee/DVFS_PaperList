| [Effects of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling on a K20 GPU](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6687422) |  | Marquette University | ICPP 2013 |Key Points: 1. MM benchmark shows performance is linearly proportional to the GPU frequency when using a high memory speed  2. CPU DVFS impacts the CPU and other system components|
| [Evaluating the energy impact of device parameters for DNN inference on edge](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3634769.3634809) |DNN inference； edge device | Stony Brook University | IGSC 2023 | Key Points: default parameter setting is not energy optimal; Power consumption increases linearly with frequency. The decrease in inference latency starts to plateau out at higher frequency as frequency is not the bottkeneck and performance is limited by other components such as memory and I/O bandwidth | |
